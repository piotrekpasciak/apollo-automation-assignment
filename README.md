Playwright solution to Apollo.io - Automation Testing Task

## Installation Instructions

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end and request testing. In previous 
interview steps it was mentioned that Apollo.io is planning to migrate to this tool from Cypress and I wanted to 
demonstrate I would be capable using it.
